    "# used for serialising and deserialising\n",
    "\n",
    "Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file. Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed. The reverse process is called deserialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Serialization allows the developer to save the state of an object and re-create it as needed, providing storage of objects as well as data exchange. Through serialization, a developer can perform actions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Sending the object to a remote application by using a web service <br>\n",
    "2.Passing an object from one domain to another <br>\n",
    "3.Passing an object through a firewall as a JSON or XML string <br>\n",
    "4.Maintaining security or user-specific information across applications <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python pickle module is used for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. Any object in Python can be pickled so that it can be saved on disk. What pickle does is that it “serializes” the object first before writing it to file. Pickling is a way to convert a python object (list, dict, etc.) into a character stream. The idea is that this character stream contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the object in another python script."
